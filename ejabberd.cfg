% This is the global configuration file for ejabberd. We use several contributed
% modules (see "Custom modules") and manage them and our ejabberd installation
% in an apt repository (see "Apt repository").
%
% This configuration file is split into several parts to increase readability.
% Also, all secrets are stored in a file "secrets.cfg" that is not shared with
% the public and contains macros used in the public config-files. With file
% inclusion and macro definition this config-file requires ejabberd 2.1.0 or
% later!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% This config-file has a global section and sections for each server %%%
%%% configured in the hosts variable. For questions ask mati@fsinf.at  %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Important notice: if you want to move a global configuration variable
% to a per-server basis (or the other way round), you have to think of one 
% thing: global variables end with a dot (since they are top-level), and
% local ones end with a colon (',').

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Apt repository %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% We manage ejabberd and all the contributed modules in our apt repository.
% The apt repository can be found at 
%    http://apt.fsinf.at
% The source for building the packages can be found at
%    http://git.fsinf.at/apt
% There is a homepage that explains what components we support:
%    https://jabber.at/en/apt-repositories

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Custom modules %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The source of the custom modules is available in an official SVN-repository:
%    https://svn.process-one.net/ejabberd-modules
% The modules are managed in our apt-repository (see above).
%
% Currently, these custom modules are installed:
% * mod_admin_extra (additional commands for ejabberdctl)
% * mod_webpresence (presence via web)
% * mod_muc_admin (muc-related commands for ejabberdctl)
% * mod_xmlrpc (XMLRPC interface, used by https://jabber.at/register)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Global Section %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% some settings completely independent of hosts

% override all global settings
override_global.
override_local.
override_acls.

% Names this node should listen on. Note that you will have to configure a 
% host_config section, before you can actually use a new server.

% We limit the Bandwith for all connections:

% * s2s is limited to 50KB/s (fast shaper)
% * c2s for normal users is limited to 1KB/s (normal shaper)

These are the configuration files used for our ejabberd installation at
jabber.at. At present we still use version 2.1.13 and therefor still the
erlang-based configuration files.

There are two files that are not included in the repository:

* secrets.cfg contains passwords. See secrets.cfg.example for the syntax.
* blocked.cfg contains blocked users. We maintain our own private list.

Feel free to contact us at xmpp:chat@conference.jabber.at for questions.

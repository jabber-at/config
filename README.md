These are the configuration files used for our ejabberd installation that hosts
**jabber.at**, **jabber.wien** and **jabber.zone**. We use the Debian package
for ejabberd available at apt.jabber.at, please see
https://jabber.at/en/apt-repository for more information.

There are two files that are not included in the repository:

* secrets.cfg contains passwords. See secrets.cfg.example for the syntax.
* blocked.cfg contains blocked users. We maintain our own private list.

Feel free to contact us at `chat@conference.jabber.at` for questions.
